The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object (the mediator) that centralizes communication between a set of objects (colleagues) within a system. Instead of objects communicating directly with each other, they communicate through the mediator. This helps reduce the dependencies between individual objects and promotes a more loosely coupled and modular design.

Key components of the Mediator Pattern:

Mediator:

Defines the interface for communication between colleagues.
Maintains references to colleagues and facilitates communication between them.
ConcreteMediator:

Implements the Mediator interface and manages the communication between colleagues.
Keeps track of the colleagues and routes messages between them.
Colleague:

Defines the interface for communication with the mediator.
Maintains a reference to the mediator.
ConcreteColleague:

Implements the Colleague interface and communicates with the mediator when it needs to interact with other colleagues.
Has a reference to the mediator.
