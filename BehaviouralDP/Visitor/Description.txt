The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a way to traverse a complex data structure (such as a tree or hierarchy) and perform operations on elements of that structure without altering their individual classes. It allows you to define new operations without modifying the classes of the elements on which these operations operate. This pattern is particularly useful when the structure of the elements is stable, but you need to add new operations frequently.

Key components of the Visitor Pattern:

Visitor:

Declares a set of methods, each corresponding to a different type of element in the object structure.
These methods typically follow a naming convention such as VisitElementA, VisitElementB, etc.
The Visitor interface may include overloads for different types of elements.
ConcreteVisitor:

Implements the methods declared in the Visitor interface.
Provides the actual implementation of the operations to be performed on elements.
Element:

Declares an Accept method that takes a visitor as an argument.
This method is implemented by concrete elements and is responsible for invoking the appropriate Visit method on the visitor.
ConcreteElement:

Implements the Accept method by calling the appropriate Visit method on the visitor.
ObjectStructure:

Represents the collection or structure of elements that the visitor will traverse.
Provides a way for visitors to access its elements.
