The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class. The State Pattern is particularly useful when an object's behavior is dependent on its state and transitions between states need to be managed without cluttering the object with a multitude of conditional statements.

Key components of the State Pattern:

Context:

Defines the interface for client communication.
Maintains an instance of a State subclass that represents the current state.
State:

Defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.
May include methods to handle requests and possibly to trigger state transitions.
ConcreteState:

Implements the behavior associated with a specific state of the Context.
