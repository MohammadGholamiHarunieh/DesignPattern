The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. 
Each handler in the chain decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
This pattern decouples the sender and receiver of a request and allows multiple objects to handle the request 
without the sender needing to know which object will ultimately process it.

Key components of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

Handler:

Declares an interface for handling requests.
Optionally, defines a reference to the next handler in the chain.
ConcreteHandler:

Implements the Handler interface.
Handles requests or passes them to the next handler in the chain.
Client:

Initiates the request and passes it to the first handler in the chain.
