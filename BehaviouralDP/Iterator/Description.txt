The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It allows clients to traverse the elements of a collection (or aggregate) without needing to know the internal structure of that collection.

Key components of the Iterator Pattern:

Iterator:

Declares the interface for accessing and traversing elements in the collection.
Usually, includes methods such as First, Next, IsDone, and Current.
ConcreteIterator:

Implements the Iterator interface and keeps track of the current position in the traversal.
Aggregate:

Defines the interface for creating an iterator object.
Typically includes a method to retrieve an iterator.
ConcreteAggregate:

Implements the Aggregate interface and provides an implementation for creating an iterator.
Represents the collection of objects being iterated.
Client:

Uses the iterator to traverse the elements of the collection without knowing its internal structure.
