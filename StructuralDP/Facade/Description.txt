The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use and reducing the complexity for clients. It involves creating a higher-level interface that hides the complexities of the subsystem and provides a single entry point for interacting with it.

Key components of the Facade Pattern:

Facade:

Defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
Manages the interactions between clients and the components of the subsystem.
Does not encapsulate the entire subsystem but provides a simplified interface to specific functionality.
Subsystem:

Consists of a set of classes or components that perform specific tasks.
Represents the lower-level functionality and complexity that is hidden from clients by the facade.
Client:

Interacts with the facade to access the subsystem's functionality without needing to understand its internal details.
Clients are shielded from the complexity of the subsystem.
