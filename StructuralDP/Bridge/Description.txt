The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates the abstraction (high-level components) from its implementation (low-level details)
so that both can vary independently. This pattern is useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation,
allowing the two to evolve independently.

Key components of the Bridge Pattern:

Abstraction:

Defines the high-level abstraction or interface that clients interact with. It contains a reference to an implementation object and delegates the actual implementation details to the implementor.
Refined Abstraction:

Extends the abstraction and refines its structure. It may add new methods or functionality on top of the basic abstraction.
Implementor:

Declares the interface for the low-level implementation that concrete implementor classes must adhere to.
Concrete Implementor:

Implements the implementor interface and provides the specific details for the low-level implementation.




The Bridge Pattern is used when there is a need to separate an abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently. It is particularly useful in the following situations:

Decoupling Abstraction and Implementation:

Use the Bridge Pattern when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation. By separating them, you allow changes in one part of the system to be independent of changes in the other part.
Supporting Multiple Platforms or Implementations:

When a system needs to run on different platforms or use different implementations (e.g., different databases, operating systems, or hardware), the Bridge Pattern helps manage these variations by encapsulating the differences in separate implementor classes.
Abstraction and Implementation Hierarchies:

Use the Bridge Pattern when you have a complex system with multiple levels of abstraction and implementation hierarchies. It allows you to avoid a combinatorial explosion of classes by organizing them into two separate hierarchies.
Changing Abstraction and Implementation Independently:

When you want to be able to change the abstraction or the implementation independently without affecting the other, the Bridge Pattern provides the necessary flexibility. This is especially useful when you expect frequent changes in one dimension (abstraction or implementation) while keeping the other relatively stable.
Complex Graphic Systems:

In graphical applications, the Bridge Pattern can be employed to separate geometric shapes from the drawing API. This allows the same shapes to be drawn using different rendering engines.
